# PasswordChecker
PasswordChecker is a final unix project I completed for my software engineering course SFWRENG 2XC3. Password checker enables the user to determine whether or not their password is strong.

# Program Description
Password checker contains 3 parts. 
1. The first part is a password setter that enables the user to set a password. If the entered password is less than 8 characters, the password is not accepted, the user gets a message notifying to make the password greater than 8 characters. If the password is accepted, it is analyzed under general good password practice rules. The result is then returned to the user as either Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
2. The user can reset their password if they desire. This requires a password to have existed in the first place. The strength analysis for the new password is then run showing the same results as the previous step.
3. The user can exit the program.

# User Interface
The user interface provided is a general menu with the three options illustrated above, as the options can be chosen at any time. The first part will run if the user presses 1, the second part will run if the user presses 2, and the third part will exit the program if the user presses 3.

# Conclusion
Overall, this project was given to test and evaluate our C and unix command skills. I found this project to be a great coding practice as an introductory course into the terminal coding world.
